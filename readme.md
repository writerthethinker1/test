## Basics to see if jekyll works...

Just files needed to see if you have jekyll and ruby installed and can make a basic webserver, render, and see the page. 

First, you'll have to install the gem 'jekyll' using `bundle install` and then use either `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve` to render the site as a local host with the baseurl: `/test/`. 

If that works, great and congrats! You can clone and fork other jekyll blog templates and install gems and use (perhaps) `relax_write`!

Enjoy the day!
